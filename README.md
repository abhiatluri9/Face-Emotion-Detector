# Real-Time Human Emotion Detector 🎭

This project is a real-time emotion recognition system that detects human facial expressions using a CNN model trained on the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and OpenCV for face detection.

🚀 Features

- Facial expression classification: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- Real-time webcam inference using OpenCV
- Uses Haar Cascade for face localization
- Custom-trained CNN model with Keras + TensorFlow
